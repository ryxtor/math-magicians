      The first solid-state electronic calculator was created in the early 1960s.
      Pocket-sized devices became available in the 1970s, especially after the Intel 4004,
      the first microprocessor, was developed by Intel for the Japanese calculator company
      Busicom. They later became used commonly within the petroleum industry (oil and gas).

      Modern electronic calculators vary from cheap, give-away, credit-card-sized models to
      sturdy desktop models with built-in printers. They became popular in the mid-1970s as
      the incorporation of integrated circuits reduced their size and cost. By the end of
      that decade, prices had dropped to the point where a basic calculator was affordable
      to most and they became common in schools.

      <br />
      Computer operating systems as far back as early Unix have included interactive calculator
      programs such as dc and hoc, and calculator functions are included in almost all personal
      digital assistant (PDA) type devices, the exceptions being a few dedicated address book
      and dictionary devices.

      In addition to general purpose calculators, there are those designed for specific markets.
      For example, there are scientific calculators which include trigonometric and statistical
      calculations. Some calculators even have the ability to do computer algebra. Graphing
      calculators can be used to graph functions defined on the real line, or higher-dimensional
      Euclidean space. As of 2016, basic calculators cost little, but scientific and graphing
      models tend to cost more.

      With the very wide availability of smartphones, tablet computers and personal computers,
      dedicated hardware calculators, while still widely used, are less common than they once were.
      In 1986, calculators still represented an estimated 41% of the world`s general-purpose
      hardware capacity to compute information. By 2007, this had diminished to less than 0.05%.
